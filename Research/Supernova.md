# Things I Don't Quite Understand
- A supernova is an explosion produced from a star, or something else? 
	- _white dwarf_ triggered by _runaway fusion_
	- _evolutionary stages_ of _massive star_
	- _progenitor_ collapses into _neutron star_, _black hole_, or gets completely destroyed to form a _fuse nebula_
	- Possible causes for the rise in a white dwarf's temperature causing runaway nuclear fusion and ultimately a supernova are the accumulation from the _binary companion_ through _accretion_ or by a _steller merger_
	- The sudden implosion of a _massive star_ is caused by the star's inner core not being able to counteract the star's gravity using the energy generated from the star's fusion. This occurs when the star begins _fusing iron_ but it may also occur during an earlier stage of _metal fusion_
