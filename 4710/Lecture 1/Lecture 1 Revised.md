# A Basic Introduction to Network Security

## What is Network Security?
Network Security refers to the domain of securing computer networks from threats. It is a subset of **Computer Security**, involving any activity designed to protect the usability and integrity of an organisation's network and data. 
### Importance of Network Security
Organisations need computers to perform their operations. Computers are devices which are used to efficiently process data. In a corporate office, workers can create documents and keep track of important information using computers. Computers also allow them to communicate with their co-workers or their bosses. In a school, computers are used to keep track of the students' classes and grades by storing that information in databases. Computers are also useful in educating students. At a cafe business, a computer is used to track orders and employee wages. The cafe might even provide its customers with Wi-Fi access, so that the customers can make better use of their own personal computers when they are within the cafe establishment. Ultimately, computers allow us to read and alter data which is very useful in getting our work done.

There are times when it will be in our interest to exert a desired level of control over the data that our computers process. If we go back to the corporate office example, we can assume that the office is probably using a computer to store important information about its employees. This information is valuable to both the organisation as a whole and the employees who work for the organisation. The organisation needs this information to manage its employees and the employees value this information because there can be a lot of risk if this information ends up in the wrong hands i.e. a criminal could use this information to impersonate and commit fraud. Computers process data which are valued by people and organisations. The value of this data incentivises people and organisations to invest in securing this data i.e. organisations have an incentive for **Computer Security**.

Organisations possess multiple computers, which transfer data with each other regularly. These computers which all transfer data with each other will collectively form an organisation's network. If an organisation acquires a new computer, that computer will become a part of its exclusive network and it will gain the ability to exchange data with the other computers on the network. It gains a foothold into the organisation's network, allowing it to have the ability of accessing the organisation's valued data. If a network is capable of exposing valued data to new computers as long as those computers join the network, then the organisation will have an incentive to secure the network. **The organisation wants to secure its computer data which also entails wanting to secure the network that those computers are a part of.** Organisations have an incentive for **Network Security**. Network Security is a subset of Computer Security, concerned with accomplishing the goals of Computer Security through the securing of the network.

Computer Security is concerned fundamentally with the security of data on a computer system. Network Security is more specific, concerning itself with a set of technologies that protect the usability and integrity of a company's infrastructure by preventing the entry or proliferation within a network by an unauthorised entity.

## Network Security: A Professional Perspective
Earlier we went over a basic overview of Network Security. We understood, generally, what Network Security is and its importance. But in order to better understand what security professionals deal with in enforcing Network Security, we should go into more technical detail.
### The Anatomy of a Network
We've established that organizations have networks which consist of multiple computers which transfer data among each other. From this perspective, you may visualise a computer network as a
